# Preamble
This file will describe the journey I took while falling down the radio rabbit hole - the highs and lows and everything inbetween. Why you would want to read this? I got no bloody idea. I guess it might be fun seeing, what the modern satellite reception experience is like. At the very least, this page will act as an archive of what I have done.

# Initial exposure
I got introduced to radio as a concept beyond AM/FM broadcasts you listen to on car rides with an incredibly interesting [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMwciWchH3Q) regarding Software Defined Radio on YouTube back in 06/2023. My interest was immediately piqued, SDR looked like a fun thing to delve into! Pulling data straight off of tin cans weighing several tons that have been flying several hundred kilometers above me since long before I was born was something I couldn't wrap my head around. 

However, I didn't give it much thought at that time - while the video was informative, it didn't show a clear path of where to begin in this hobby and resources for learning anything about it are incredibly limited, given its niche nature. It took me several months to find relevant guides and people knowledgeable in this field that were willing to help.

# Early interest
While just idling on Discord back in 09/2023, I saw someone post a picture of a raw APT image, a black and white image pulled from a satellite that was covered in the aforementioned presentation. After a bit of contemplation I messaged them, `somerandomdragon`, with the usual questions - How, What, and How much does it cost to set up?

Being able to talk to an actual person was a huge deal, he helped me with the simplest concepts - what an SDR is, what the received images are and how it is possible to receive them in practice etc. This led me to buy a Nooelec Smart SDR V5, the SDR I used for the better part of 6 months. I bought it for dirt cheap from a second hand market, but I believe the person selling it runs a shop or something of that matter - it was packaged professionally. Looking back I am extremely surprised I managed to even find an SDR being sold near me, much less a reputable brand!

The SDR has proven to be reliable and - as will be explained later - maybe even rare.

# Rough beginnings
At first, I went by the definition of what an antenna is - "Anything conductive", and stuck a wire right into the SMA port with the second end wrapped around the core of my flats old, hardwired DVB-T antenna's coaxial cable. The janky setup introduced too many losses to be useful at any level. Please learn from me and don't stick wires into fragile SMA ports. ~~If you miss your wife that much, get a girlfriend dude.~~

Thinking the signals were there but were just too weak, I bought a wideband LNA and actual conenctors (Thank god for the latter) in hopes of being able to use the DVB-T antenna for this stuff, not knowing the its balun had rusted to hell making the antenna nothing more than scrap.

By now I was several days and euros down with nothing but static in results, primarily because I followed old guides and simply had inadequate equipment. This continued for a bit.

# First images
After a lot more research and failed attempts I finally decided to make a proper antenna made for this, a V-dipole antenna - the type of antenna I should have been using since the beginning. But as it goes, instead of holding it by a terminal like a normal person it was on a two meter long wooden board and hanging from my balcony. It looked just as dangerous as it sounds.

This resulted in my true first APT:

![First APT picture I ever received](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/First-APT-I-got.png)
*NOAA 18 received on 12/10/2023 using a V-dipole nailed to a wooden board sticking outside of my balcony. Decoded using WxToImg.*

The result is about what you'd expect for a first APT reception.

The setup I had should have worked in theory, but I had two major issues - there is a cell tower just a few hundred meters away overloading my SDR to hell and back, I could only see the satellite for a very short amount of time while it was directly overhead. After a bit of thought I realized, that I could use some old materials from our decrepit shed at my cottage as a stand for a very tall V-dipole fixture which would have GREAT LOS with the sky. Some zipties and gluing stuff together later, I concocted this:

![The original V-dipole fixture](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/Original-V-Dipole-fixture.png)
*The original V-dipole fixture I had at my cottage.*

As janky as it looks, it worked very well and allowed me to get some great APT images:

![First actually good APT](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/First-good-APT-N15.png)
*NOAA 15 received on 13/10/2023 using a V-dipole. Decoded using SatDump. (Alignment algorithm couldn't handle the scan motor issues, is the reason the middle of the image is cut up.)*

What at first looks like black and white image barely containing any decernible imagery remains one of the best APT transmissions I have gotten when considering the length and cleanliness. How a V-Dipole managed to get no nulls is beyond me. 

> NOAA 15 was having some *major* scan motor issues at that time, causing the glitching present instead of actual imagery. The satellite has since completely recovered and remains to be the oldest satellite still broadcasting APT.

I managed to get a few other satellites just after, most notably NOAA 19 passing shortly after NOAA 15:

![Second actually good APT](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/Second-good-APT-N19.png)
*NOAA 19 received on 13/10/2023 using a V-Dipole. Decoded using SatDump.*

After all this time and effort, I finally had imagery I considered worthy. It's at about this time, that I had joined the SDR++ and SigIdWiki Discord servers. They told me how god awful and outdated my software setup was, which I am still incredibly grateful for - I was following a guide from 2007 until that point. After downloading SatDump and SDR++, everything became *incomparably more streamlined* with the results showing a bunch of improvements.

During this initial weekend, I spent the late nights sitting in a lawn chair with a headlamp looking like a complete madman trying to pull images from tin cans screaming out what they are seeing 24/7. Try explaining THAT to your parents!


# First portable images
After the weekend was over I took the fixture down (It was basically a big lightning rod with a pretty cable run along it) and went back home. After some thinking and discussion with others, I made my first potable V-dipole, two copper wires wired up properly using a terminal... but nailed to a wooden board *\<facepalms\>*.

The results were filled with static, were absolutely useless even with heavy median blur.

After removing the wires from the bloody wooden board and finally just holding the cables by the electrical terminal, I got some not great but not terrible images.

![Portable APT result](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/Portable-APT.png)
*NOAA 18 received on 25/10/2023 using a V-Dipole. Processed using SatDump. Left side is black due to NOAA 18's config error.*

I also tried buying an FM filter which would allow me to use an LNA at home without my SDR overloading, **RIGHT** before the first pass began, I could see that the noise floor significantly raised when I put pressure on the SMA port, after inspecting it more closely I realized that it had basically no solder on the SMA port with the core pin hanging in the air. After returning home and adding some solder to get a good contact, I went out again - no matter, I was still goint to get some great passe- 

The whole SMA port snapped right off. I didn't put a lot of pressure put on it, it was just incredibly fragile and broke off when screwing my LNA onto it. I tried to solder the port back on and succeeded! But, after going out for the last set of the days passes, I found, that no signals were present on the FFT until I put pressure on the whole board - as if there was still a bad connection somewhere, but where?!

Upon closer inspection, the central inductors - the parts that actually filter the signal - were snapped. **All 3 of them!** This turned the filter into nothing more than a fancy paperweight. I *tried* to repair these, but it was a lost cause. I ended up salvaging the SMA ports and just throwing it out.

# What's next?
Having received APT and knowing that LRPT was out of reach due to Meteor-M NÂ°2-3 being a bloody cripple (Its VHF antenna hasn't deployed properly, making the signal much weaker than intended), I felt like I have conquered VHF. I didn't do much for the next two months, but *oooh boy* did December get busy.

# Growing ambitions
The next logical step after VHF was doing HRPT in the L-band - a much harder to receive broadcast that contains high resolution images broadcasted by a lot more satellites. Doing this would have me commit much more time and effort to this hobby, as well as purchase a lot more equipment, but I went by the one and only slogan: ***Fuck it, we ball***

I had initially hoped, that the generic wideband LNA was going to be good enough to get at least get SOMETHING, given that I had an above average sized dish (90cm) (Barely above average, that being 80 cm. Not like I was aware of that at that time). This, as everyone was warning me on every step of the way, turned out to be false and a complete waste of time.

# First L-band attempts
My first setup was jank galore - awful helix, LNA and SDR sticking out the rear with the whole setup hanging on a tiny SMA port (This came back to bite me in me arse later down the road), piss poor soldering job, glue drizzled all over the reflector and god awful tracking skills. All of these combined to give me what I deserved: disappointment.

![A picture of the jankiest helix you have ever seen](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/God-awful-first-helix.png)

It felt like the signal was just out of reach - I could even see the carrier wave! (Spoiler: It wasn't. It was actually far, FAR out of reach.)

![Dissapointing SatDump screenshot showing barely a hint of a signal](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/HRPT-disappointment-ss.png)
*Pictured is SatDump, on the awfully set up FFT you can see the barely visible carrier and spikes of the BPSK HRPT broadcast I was attempting to get.*

I initially believed it was a helix issue, which it partially was - I put glue all over it completely disregarding, that **the reflector should remain as clear as possible to be as effective as possible**. After heating up a knife and melting some of the hot glue off, redoing the solder job and mounting the SMA port to the reflector properly using an SMA nut (Thanks for the suggestion, Ryzerth), the signal grew strong enough to even get a few frames!

![A newer SatDump screenshot, now showing a much stronger albeit still useless HRPT signal](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/New-helix-who-this.png)

This got me my first official HRPT image: Drumroll please...

![First HRPT image](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/First-HRPT-attempt.png)
*NOAA 19 HRPT received on 31/12/2023 using a 90cm dish and a generic wideband LNA. Decoded using SatDump with the `543b` RGB composite. Median blur and equalization applied.*

A terrible image, **who would have thought!** It is fairly short, because it was the only attempt I had at using this setup and it was cut short because it started raining cats and dogs all of a sudden. I couldn't retry later because of issues I will describe in a bit. 

**At this point I gave up on trying to get this generic trash to work, finally ordered a SawBird GOES+ off of Amazon.**


# VHF part two: The electric boogaloo
Instead of waiting for the LNA to arrive, I decided to fill in the time with some good ole VHF! I tried to put the tall V-dipole fixture back up, but I quickly realized, that it won't be as simple this time - my neighbor had plugged in some goofy chinese power supply that was spewing RFI all over the bloody spectrum, crippling my morning reception capabilities and limiting my gain severly. Ouch! 

While setting the fixture back up, I also **significantly** misread the coaxial cables attenuation - upping the loss by a factor of 10. What I thought was a 2 dB (36%) loss of signal was actually just a measly 0.2 dB (4.5%) loss. Why am I mentioning it? I tried cutting the coax as short as possible to keep the incorrect loss as low as possible. I originally didn't save on coaxial cable - I have several hundred meters in a cabinet that my father used back in the day. 

My original setup comfortably reached a **table I set everything down on**, this time I cut it to be **hanging in the air** while saving about a metre (.05 dB). What could go wrong, right?

# LNA meltdown
Right before the first pass began, after wiring everything up and sitting down, I heard a loud *crack* followed by the noise floor dropping significantly with all signals disappearing. I found this unusual but didn't think much of it - this has happened before, I always just had to tighten the connectors. When trying to tighten the SMA port on my LNA, I immediately noticed it was completely loose. Has ANOTHER port snapped off?!

Knowing the pass was ruined, I just went inside to try to diagnose and potentially repair the LNA, this wasn't my first time having issues with snapped off SMA ports after all.

After opening it up and inspecting it, I found the entire sma trace to be sticking out! I had no idea what to do about it, just left it in the corner of my room collecting dust for the time being.

As for the V-dipole fixture, all I was getting was very poor & static filled images without the LNA. I tore the setup down, laying down in defeat.

# Revisiting old ideas
I wasn't going to spend the whole winter break just farting around though, I thought back to an old attempt of mine: A Yagi-Uda antenna. I made one back in October using the same wooden board I used for the first V-dipole, but got no results with it and used it a total of two times so I didn't bother mentioning it here. 

Unlike then, this time I could make it with **much more precision** and **space to move around**, unlike my apartment's balcony (The thing is about two metres long and a metre wide, good luck manouvering that in a small apartment balcony!)

I then created this beauty:

![My first proper yagi-uda](../../../assets/images/Radio/My-VHF-yagi.png)

What it doesn't make up in looks it makes up for tenfold in performance - I managed to get the **best** APT and LRPT to date, the antenna providing some stunning results:

![A processed APT image](../../../assets/images/Radio/APT-Sample-image.png)
*APT image received using a 5 element yagi on 02-01-2024 from NOAA 18, processed using Satdump with the `HVC` RGB composite. Equalized.*

*LRPT image received using a 5 element yagi on 02-01-2024 from Meteor M2-3, processed using Satdump with the `221` RGB composite. Equalized.*


# LNA repair attempt
After a lot of thinking I realized, that the trace before the SMA port was still intact, there was another thing I could connect the SMA port to - a transistor right before the solder pad! Soldering a wire between it and the SMA port's core should work perfectly fine! I didn't fully trust myself with this at that time, so I left it to my father.

My father called me over after half an hour of swearing coming from my room with a working LNA! Something I didn't notice at that time though: he accidentally bumped an innocent little diode off. *I'm sure this diode is not important at all and that the LNA will work reliably and well until the end of times!* ~~(Foreshadowing is a narrative device in which a storyteller gives an advance hint of what is to come later in the story.)~~

After going outside, the LNA worked for a total of five minutes before breaking off again, at this point I was THIS close to giving up and giving it the Cardi B treatment - but I had to at least give the soldering a shot myself first! By some miracle, I actually managed to solder the SMA port back on properly, even having it allign with the case perfectly! However at the same time, the SawBird had arrived and I shifted my attention to it and my L-band setup, stowing the working (for now) LNA for later use.

![The sloppy patch job I had to do on the LNA](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/LNA-patch-job.png)
*The somehow fully functional setup. The picture has a lot of leftover flux on it that I didn't remove yet.*

The LNA's story doesn't end on a happy note though. The diode that my father accidentally broke off? Yeah, that turned out to be the ESD protection. After using it in late february at home for some weak FM reception, the LNA suddenly stopped working. After checking it with a multimeter, I found the LNA chip to have failed and be shorted to ground. This was likely caused by ESD discharge from the long coax run I was using. Damn.


# L-Band second attempt
After the SawBird arrived, it was time for action. Whipping my old setup out with the remade helix, I connected a short SMA wire to the helix and my new SawBird to it, something that at the time seemed sensible to - as I learned the hard way - not strain the LNA's SMA port too much by having it hang in the air. 

![My initial SawBird setup](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/Initial-sawbird-setup.png)

I initially thought I was about to get the stunning images that HRPT promised, but as it turned out...

![SatDump image showing a relatively weak Meteor-M HRPT broadcast](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/Initial-Sawbird-SatDump-ss.png)
*You can see that I was actually getting a few dBs this time, MUCH better than before! The signal was still far too weak for a good decode though.*

![Very cut up HRPT composite](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/Initial-Sawbird-image.png)
*Meteor M2-3 received on 12/1/2024 using a 90cm dish, a SawBird GOES+. Processed using SatDump with the `654` RGB composite.*

Absolutely terrible. I was supposed to be getting gorgeous high res images, not this cut up junk! What was I doing wrong?! Pass after pass I got the same disappointing results, just as I was losing hope thinking this was as good as it gets I did the bold thing of **removing the cable and connecting the LNA directly to the helix.**

The first pass after, lo and behold:

![SatDump screenshot showing a very strong NOAA HRPT broadcast](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/First-great-HRPT-SatDump.png)
*16 dB! This is more than enough for a gorgeous image and decode, an incomparable improvement!*

*NOAA 18 recieved on 13/1/2024 using a 90 cm dish and a SawBird GOES+. Processed using SatDump with the `NOAA Natural Color` RGB composite. Equalized.*

Gorgeous image after gorgeous image, this is where my HRPT journey truly started.

# Golden age of HRPT

![Best HRPT to date](../../../assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/Best-HRPT-yet.png)
*NOAA 19 received on 14/1/2024 using a 90 cm dish and a SawBird GOES+. Processed using SatDump with the `NOAA Natural Color` RGB composite. Median blur applied, equalized. My single best HRPT image to date*

The last thing I intended to try was receiving geostationary satellites, this turned out to be fairly difficult on the 90 cm dish, as the signals are very weak and the only relevant geostationary satellites are very low over the horizon. The only real satllite I could have tried was Elektro-L3, which I did:

![Elektro-L3, first good full disc image](/assets/images/Sat-reception-journey/First-earth-picture.png)
*Elektro-L N3 LRIT received on 14/1/2024 using a 90 cm dish and a SawBird GOES+. Decoded using SatDump. Pictured is the autogenerated `NC` (Natural Color) composite.*

Besides the blue line caused by me moving just by the slightest bit (The decode required a LOT of precision, it is hard holding a 90cm dish in your hands with gusts of wind), this is still by far the coolest thing I have done to date.


# 125 cm dish
After having my fair share of fun, I decided it was time to move on from the 90 cm dish - while it was great for HRPT, it just doesn't cut it for higher bands and some other geostationary satellites. After looking at second hand markets for weeks I found **2** people selling dishes larger than 100 cm - One guy selling one for ~80â¬, and the other selling it for 5â¬ with a kjghillion grammar errors in the title. I think you can guess which one I hit up.

After receiving the dish (Which was a whole endeavour on its own), remaking my helix once again and mounting my hrpt setup to it, I managed to get a much stronger Elektro-L LRIT broadcast (8 dB compared to just 3 dB prior), HRPT went up to 25 dB from 17 dB. It is definitely needed for what's to come (:

As for the results:

*Elektro-L N3 LRIT received on 11/2/2024 using a 125 cm dish and a SawBird GOES+. Decoded using SatDump. Pictured is the autogenerated `NC` (Natural Color) composite. Fun fact: This was taken in the middle of a rainstorm with a plastic bag over the SDR and an umbrella over my head. It was just as clunky as you expect.*

# S-band dreams
Having basically conquered L-band, the next viable thing I could try was the S-band - 2.2 GHz. Requiring the purchase of an MMDS with a suitable frequency range and modifying it to be usable for satellite reception, it was by no means going to be an easy task.

In an stroke of false luck, after looking around for a while, I managed to find a person selling an MMDS with a suitable range -> 2.1 - 2.3 GHz. Not only was this MMDS in the range of LTE/GSM, it was also a just a chinese clone. This would come to bite me in my arse later down the road.


# More money down the rabbit hole
After playing around with L & S bands and even having pipe dreams of doing X-band some day, it has become apparent that the Nesdr V5 doesn't cut it anymore. Don't get me wrong, it is a GREAT SDR, but only having 2.88 Msps has bit me in my arse one too many times. It was time for an upgrade.

> 2.88 Msps somehow worked on my tablet and remained completely stable, was the mode I used the most often.

Looking at my options, they were extremely limited - good SDRs at the 100â¬ price bracket with high sampling rates were very sparse. The only SDRs I found able to pull more than the measly 2.88 Msps of the RTL820T chipset were:
- The AirSpy Mini clocking in at 6 Msps, still not enough for most advanced applications (X-band requiring >15 Msps)
- The MiriSDR, a surprisinmgly capable and cheap SDR (Even though it is quite deaf, requiring an additional LNA) from Aliexpress clocking in at 10 Msps. Close, but still not enough.
- The one and only... HackRf clone. 

If you don't know much about it, you might call me a moron for WILLINGLY buying a clone, but the SDR is actually nothing short of incredible! I got a version redesigned by *Clifford Heath* an engineer who made it much more resilient to accidents as well as making the frontend amplifier actually usable. Not only was it arguably better than the original, it was also priced at a **third (!)** of the original while having the aforementioned protections.

But the main selling point of the hackrf? Not only is it fully capable of doing satellite stuff, it can even pull a relatively monstrous **20 Msps!** This is far more than enough for almost any application I can try in the future, excluding some insane 30 Msps satellites. Future-proofing FTW!
